# zig-wlroots

Idiomatic [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) bindings for
[wlroots](https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots).

*Note: these bindings are early in development and should not be considered
as stable as wlroots*

### Dependencies

`zig-wlroots` of course depends on wlroots and all of its dependencies. In
addition, [zig-wayland](https://github.com/ifreund/zig-wayland) is required.

### TODO

- [ ] Bind enough to port [tinwyl](https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/tree/master/tinywl)
- [ ] Bind enough to port [river](https://github.com/ifreund/river)
- [ ] Complete bindings
